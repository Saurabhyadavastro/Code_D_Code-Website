# Light Mode Theme Toggle - Bug Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The Projects, Team (exec-team.html), and Contact pages were missing the `main.js` script inclusion, which contains the theme toggle functionality.

## Root Cause
While the CSS and JavaScript for the theme toggle were properly implemented, the script wasn't being loaded on the affected pages, so the theme toggle button wasn't being created and the theme switching functionality wasn't available.

## Solution Applied
Added the missing script inclusion to all affected pages:

### Files Fixed:
1. **pages/projects.html** ✅
2. **pages/contact.html** ✅ 
3. **pages/exec-team.html** ✅

### Script Added:
```html
<!-- Custom JS -->
<script src="../scripts/main.js"></script>
```

## How Theme Toggle Works:
1. **JavaScript Creates Button**: `initializeThemeToggle()` creates a floating theme toggle button
2. **CSS Styling**: Button is positioned fixed at top-right with glassmorphism effect
3. **Theme Switching**: Toggles between `data-theme="dark"` and `data-theme="light"` on html element
4. **Persistence**: Theme choice is saved in localStorage
5. **Icon Update**: Button icon changes between moon (for light mode) and sun (for dark mode)

## Theme System Features:
- **Position**: Fixed top-right corner (20px from edges)
- **Design**: Glassmorphism effect with backdrop blur
- **Animation**: Hover scale effect and glow
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels
- **Persistence**: Theme preference saved across sessions
- **Icons**: Font Awesome moon/sun icons

## Current Status:
✅ All pages now have theme toggle functionality
✅ Light/Dark mode works consistently across the website
✅ Theme preference is saved and restored on page loads
✅ Professional glassmorphism design matches website aesthetic

## To Test:
1. Visit any page on the website
2. Look for the circular theme toggle button in the top-right corner
3. Click to switch between light and dark themes
4. Navigate between pages to verify theme persistence
5. Refresh page to ensure theme is remembered

The theme toggle should now be visible and functional on all pages including Projects, Team, and Contact pages.
